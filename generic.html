							<h1>About</h1>
							<p>Swarm is a social media website for Wellingtonians to connect with each other. Inspired by the iconic Beehive Parliament building in the heart of Wellington, Swarm imagines residents as bees of a hive, bringing people together for both work and hobbies, as well as helping the more vulnerable members of the community.</p>
							<p>As Wellington slowly opens back up after recovering from Covid-19, Swarm aims to connect members of the community that are isolated or have no family nearby, particularly elderly people.  Local residents can organize meet ups of all sorts from book clubs to gaming nights and offer help or work such as lawn mowing or babysitting. Swarm is a very community based website/app that works to connect people of Wellington who might not otherwise meet each other, despite having common needs and interests.</p>
