							<h1>Features</h1>
							<h2>Comment</h2>
							<p>Verified users are able to comment on public forum posts and reply to other comments. </p>
							<h2>Tags</h2>
							<p>When making a post, users can add tags to the top which allows other users to sort by specific tags they are interested in, instead of having to sort through unnecessary posts. Some of these tags could include the nature of the post (e.g work, hobby, help needed) or what general area the user is posting from (e.g CBD, Thorndon, Newlands, Kelburn).</p>
							<h2>Message</h2>
							<p>Swarm also supports private messages, in which users can reply to a post or ask for more information without having to post a public comment. Only verified users can send private messages to other verified users.</p>
							<h2>Post</h2>
							<p>Users can post on a public forum with specific tags that they can select such as ‘help’, ‘work’ and ‘connect’ which can be filtered too. It is important to note that only verified users are able to post to forums so that each post is from a guaranteed Wellingtonian. </p>
