							<h1>Security</h1>
							<p>Swarm uses HTTPS, for a much more secure connection than that of a regular HTTP connection.</p>
							<p>Like other popular social media or even websites that store personal information such as email, Swarm uses 2-factor-authentication where users are able to connect their mobile phone to receive a confirmation text with a code every time they log in. If this feature is enabled, after inputting their password users are then prompted to enter the unique 6 digit code that has just been sent to them. This code is for a 1 time use and will expire as soon as it has been used or another unique code has been generated for the account.</p>
							<p>As Swarm also holds sensitive information such as usersâ€™ addresses if they choose to become a verified member, it is important to make this information as secure as possible. While other users will be able to see the account is verified, only the user will be able to see their address in their account settings. This is because while Swarm aims to bring Wellingtonians together, it recognises that there is risk involved when giving out personal information to strangers who live in close proximity. </p>
